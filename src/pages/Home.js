            Hi. Welcome to "I wanna learn Linux". This is a tutorial for
            beginners so that they can start leraning Linux. It is 100% free and
            you can even copy and share it elsewhere because first, I don't
            intend to make money out of this and second, the whole purpose of
            this is to be a help to the newcomers. You can take a look at the
            license if you want.
          </p>
          <p className="home__paragraph">
            The tutorial consists of a number of chapters, carefully organized
            so that you learn the fundamentals first and the composite stuff
            last. That is why I (the original author) suggest that you better
            start at the very beginning and work your way through the end one
            step at a time. If you think you really know the fundamentals, then
            by all means, head over to where you think you need to learn. For
            example, if you already have a Linux system installed, you may skip
            the installation chapters.

            The source consists of markdown files, so anyone can easily change
            it to make it better. If you think you need to make it better, just
            create a new branch and make that god damn pull request :) So let's
            begin, shall we?
