Now that we know what it is, we need to decide if it's something worth learning. You can do some research for yourself and find information on what are the high and low points of Linux. This is actually the proper way to decide if you want to learn something new. But in case of something as controversial as Linux, this may not be the best way, since what you'll get is the subjective opinions of people who love Linux or who hate it. Here I tried to be objective, but of course, that's impossible. My suggestion to you is that you should do your research first, then consider reading this chapter as yet another subjective opinion of someone in favor of Linux. So let's begin with the pros first.

## Why is Linux worth it?

### Free

> Linux is free as in speech not as in beer!

This sentence is a famous one among the Linux community. The purpose of it is to clarify the difference between "costless" and "freedom". Basically consider you're in a bar and someone wants to celebrate an event by buying everyone beer. There, you get a "free beer" which is costless. But when you talk about free speech, you mean the freedom to be able to say whatever you want. Free in this context means "freedom". So when we say Linux is free, we mean that it gives you the freedom additional to it being costless.

So not only you can get Linux distros for free, but also they allow you to completely change the software to your needs. There is no limit to this, literally. If you want to learn more about this, just search about GNU GPL which is the GNU General Public License. You may be amazed by the amount of freedom it gives you. For instance, GPL lets you use the software for free, change the software for free and redistribute the software for free. The only limitation you have is that if you redistribute the software, you must do it with the same license :) So that the freedom is kept forever. This alone is something that made me fell in love with the community despite its brutal forums and angry users :P

### Customizable

I think this is a self-explanatory point now that you know how much freedom you have in a Linux system. Let's say you use Windows or Mac, you have a settings section that you can customize your operating system's looks and behavior. In Linux, you have the same thing, but also, you have the ability to change the underlying code and make something that nobody else has, and even better, you can distribute that change so that everyone can use it! This has led to some concepts that are new on Linux. Let me give you an example. On Windows and Mac, you have a user interface that never changes. Sure you can alter the theme, change the font, or change the wallpaper. But in Linux, there are different desktop environments! What I mean is that if you don't like what you see, then you can choose another look and feel and change the whole desktop. It may be vague to you what I mean by desktop, but don't worry, because we are going to do all that together :) For now, to get a feeling of what I mean, just search for “Linux desktop environments” and look at the pictures to see how variant it is. Let's say you want your Linux to be as efficient as possible, you can install a desktop that is lightweight and featureless, for instance, your Linux alone can take only up to 400 MB of RAM or in case of other desktops it can take up to 1.5 GB of RAM. It all depends on what you like.

### Stable

You may be surprised to know that most of our internet is hosted on Linux servers. The reason is that Linux can be very stable. Now this doesn't mean that your Linux desktop will be rock solid. That's a different story. Linux as a server is designed to be rock solid when it comes to stability. There are numerous reasons why that's the case but I don't want to bore you with those (and hell, I don't know all the reasons). Linux (the kernel) is absolutely rock solid both on desktop computers and on servers. One of the main reasons for this stability is the nature of open-source programs. Because these programs are written by the community and everything is open, bugs are solved faster because people with different abilities are gathered together to solve them. Compare this to a company like Microsoft which has a limited number of programmers. Now I should mention that not everything is unicorn and rainbows in Linux. We have programs that are not developed as frequently compared to their equivalents on Windows and this lack of development causes annoying bugs from time to time. But the base system and major programs are usually more stable than Windows or Mac.

### Knowledge-based environment

In Linux, you will gain knowledge more often. This may seem to be a made-up and extremely subjective point at first, but I believe most Linux (or Unix) users agree with me on this. The reason for this is the nature of the ecosystem. Let me compare this to Windows (sorry Microsoft). You install windows and you realize there's a problem with your audio. You call support and they usually tell you to restart! I even saw instructions like reinstall Windows :/ But the best case is that they give you some sort of troubleshooter that handles the situation for you. But in Linux, there is usually no support service for you to call! There are forums filled with enthusiastic people, eager to answer questions and help others (though they may not be the best-tempered people in the world). You make an account, ask your question and get pointed to resources like Arch Wiki for more information. You'll be forced to learn to fix your problem. Sure this is not the easiest way to resolve your issue, but you'll learn something in the process and as time goes on, you learn more and more and resolve your issues faster and faster. You learn how to get information, how to troubleshoot manually, how to ask good questions, how to view the log files, ... I think you get the idea.

### Safe

Did you know that we don't have any Anti-virus programs in Linux? Don't you think that tells you a little bit about the software architecture and the superior design of Linux over Windows or Mac? Well I'd leave this for you to search for it yourself.

### Fast and Eco-friendly

Since you have total control over your system, you can remove most parts of it! I don't want a fancy desktop with lots of blur and transparency and animations. Why should I be forced to use those? I can easily remove them however I wish to do so. Don't get me wrong, it's not about compromising for your weak hardware. I happen to believe that the more my laptop uses its CPU and GPU to show me fancy stuff, the more power it uses. And we all know where power comes from. It may sound stupid and idiotic for most people, but let me be the idiot who avoids blurry background eye candy in favor of a slight improvement in our earth's health. The less my system works for no reason, the better I feel about myself. I usually remove the unnecessary parts of my operating system and leave only what I need, sort of a minimalistic approach. This results in a faster experience and more efficient power usage.

### More eye candy

This is exactly the opposite of the previous point! You can add tons of beautiful effects to your operating system as you wish, believe me, you can make your desktop look like a game with wobbly windows that emulate some kind of jello window movement or any other sort of cute stuff. This is not what I personally like but if you do, I suggest you search for "Unix porn" on Reddit and see how beautiful Linux (and Unix) can get.

### Some bragging rights

- Linux is used in the international space station
- Top 500 supercomputers of the world use Linux (at the time of writing)
- Most of the internet is hosted on Linux servers
- CERN uses Linux

## Why Linux may not be right for you?

### Lack of software

Linux is a free and open project with no profit. This introduces some difficulties, imagine this: There is a company that made an operating system and put billions of dollars into it. It collaborates with other companies to provide the best they can. Now there is a community-based project that tries to compete with this huge giant. Which do you think wins in software support? Obviously the former. Windows and Mac are huge companies with enormous budgets, they collaborate with companies like Nvidia and Adobe to provide the best experience for end-users. Now Linux is amazing in itself, but these companies don't really care to provide support for a free project like Linux. Take the evil Adobe, for example, they don't have any support for Linux whatsoever :/ They just don't care. They need the money and this isn't a profitable path for them to invest in. That's why there isn't as much software for Linux as there is for Windows or Mac. For instance in the case of video editors, Linux only has three professional ones (Davinci resolve, blender and kdenlive), but if you consider Windows, you have many more choices. However, for photo editing (which is my jam!), Linux has incredible equivalents, we have darktable and gimp which are amazing free software. So before migrating completely, you need to check for the software you need and make sure they are available on Linux.

### Command-line driven

In windows almost everything has a GUI, you can click through menus and top-bars and all that to get your job done. But in Linux not everything has the GUI tool, most serious programs use configuration files for their settings. And so you need to be working with text files or command-line utilities (which is why this book focuses on that). This is not a bad thing in itself, in fact this command-line nature of Linux is what makes automation and scripting much more useful. But there are people who just don't like this. Although they are just lazy in my opinion, they have a right to choose. So if you're lazy and you want to do everything through menus and mouse clicks, Linux may disappoint you considerably.

### Games

This falls into the "lack of software" section but I thought I should mention it because the case of games is much worse. Up until most recently, there was an incredibly small amount of games for Linux. I would even dare to say compared to Windows, there were none. But steam changed this. Now you can install steam and play lots of games on Linux, but still, games are very rarely found on Linux as they are on Windows.

## Conclusion

If you're still here, you seem to be one of us :D Welcome fellow Linux enthusiast. In the next chapter, we are going to learn the methods we can use to install Linux. I hope you are ready to learn the most exciting and amazing operating system in the world :) See you on the other side (next page?)
