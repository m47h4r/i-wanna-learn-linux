You may think to yourself that I'm crazy. That may be true to an extend, but regarding editing files, I actually do have something to say, though it may sound ridiculous at first sight. One important fact is that most configuration files in Linux, are in forms of text files. Now you can simply use any desired text editor for editing such files and that's fine. But what if your X server (the software that handles graphics) fails to load. Or maybe that your graphics card driver fails. In those cases, you will need to be fixing the problems via the command line. And you need a text editor to be able to edit files in just the command line. Thus, introducing terminal-based text editors.

# nano

The easiest one to learn. In fact you don't even need to learn it, just use trial and error. Once you know that it is there, you already know how to use it. The command keys are listed on the bottom when you open it and that pretty much is all you need to know.

That is good enough to satisfy your text editing needs. But over time and slowly, but surely, you'll be introduced to other editors :) The two most important ones are listed below.

# Vim

This goddamn thing. As Michael Scott would say it, "I hate that I love it". It ruins every other editor for you. Seriously, the key combinations make sense, and once you get used to them, it's extremely hard to enjoy working with other editors. I didn't like it at first, obviously. It needs some practice to get even productive in it. But once you get going, it becomes a very crazy good editor. I'm not suggesting that you learn it right now, because it's not like a mandatory thing, what I'm saying is that put it in your long-term todo list and learn it some time, after you are comfortable with your Linux and are looking for new things to learn. Never rush to learn it, because it's like the best hamburger in new york, it'll make other hamburgers taste like feet (HIMYM reference intended).

# Emacs

This used to be close to an operating system in the old days. It has too many features and it is really amazing. Most people make a fight between choosing this and Vim, but the fact of the matter is that Vim wins anyway (I'm of course kidding). Try them both, and use whichever you like the best. Some people swear on them, and pray to the gods of Vim and Emacs. Maybe you'll become a follower too.

# Conclusion

Edit your files in the most efficient way possible. Learn command-line editors and practice them. Once you learn something like Vim, you won't be going back to graphical editors (unless it's some IDE like vscode or atom for programming). Learn to appreciate these free tools at your disposal instead of holding stupid fights between them. Learn to see them as tools in an actual toolbox. You'll never compare a flat-head screwdriver with a phillips or torx. They're all screwdrivers, but they have different uses in their appropriate context. Be wise and make the most of what is available to you. Try not to fall into a group trying to disprove others.
