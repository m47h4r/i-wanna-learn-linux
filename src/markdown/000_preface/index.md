Since the dawn of time, humans have been using computers to automate repetitive and mathematical processes. Through the ups and downs, they came to the knowledge of bundling sets of software and calling it operating system. Operating systems are the boilerplate on which users build, use and enjoy software. Famous operating systems such as Windows and MacOS are easy-to-use and friendly and thus need no formal introduction. But there are darker (both, literally and figuratively) and more interesting operating systems, namely Linux and Unix-based ones. These however, are not immediately appreciated upon first sight. They, just like good a novel, require multiple reads and a deeper level of thinking. Here, we are going to be seeing a family of these operating systems, Linux or more technically, GNU/Linux.

You have a job in IT, you are a system administrator, you are a curious kid who likes to mess with computers and get the most out of them, ... Doesn't matter how you're here, what matters is that you are willing to take the time and read to learn Linux. That's all the motivation you need. Trust me and follow me on this journey that we take together into the deep beautiful oceans of Linux :) Without further ado, Let's jump in the chapter where I talk about what I'm going to talk about!
