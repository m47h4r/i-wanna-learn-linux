Congratulations, to both you and me. You finished reading, and I finished writing (for now). Phew! Now is the time to move on. Thankfully we don't have strong feelings like the end of TV shows (need I remind you the end of Friends?).

# Scripting

You can learn bash script right now :D YAY! Believe me, you'll thank yourself that you did. Being able to automate your daily tasks is really cool. For instance, writing a script to encrypt a bunch of files and compress and archive them for storage. Or writing simple scripts to handle commons tasks like converting .MOV raw videos into common .mp4. etc etc etc. Whatever you can do with terminal, you can do in scripting and more. You can learn it on your own, by searching for different things (like I did) or you can search for tutorials on the internet.

# Certificates

If you are planning to become a system administrator. You may want to look into Linux certificates, among those are LPIC, Redhat certificates and so on. You'll be surprised how easy LPIC 1 is since you already know a good deal from this tutorial. Go ahead. Good luck on your professional career.

# Conclusion

All right. But you are just starting to learn. This whole tutorial was the equivalent of dipping your toe in the ocean. Now is the time to dive. Take off your safety jackets (metaphorically!!!) and start swimming toward the sunset in the beautiful creamy dusk light. Dramatic endings are always a good idea. Anyway, I'm glad that you're here and that my efforts didn't go to waste. For now, it's just me writing, but since the project is on Github, it may lead to contributions from different people, and who knows, maybe someday it'll become so good that I wouldn't even be able to say that it's my tutorial. Let's hope for those days :) I hope you have a good life...
