Remember the chapter where we mounted partitions? Well now we can create those partitions and talk even more about disks and how they work. To be able to follow this chapter, you need a disk to be working with, if you are using Linux on a physical machine that could be achieved by inserting a flash drive into your computer but if on the other hand, youâ€™re using a virtual machine, you need to make a virtual disk. We already did that too in the aforementioned chapter, so go ahead and get your setup ready.

# Partition Table

We can have a certain number of disks in our computers. If you open a computer case, you can actually see the disks attached usually to the SATA interfaces. These are actual physical devices. But due to different reasons, we may want to divide up these disks into smaller sections. These sections are called partitions. You usually see them as "drives" in a Windows machine. But we should have a record of how many partitions we have and what their boundaries are. These are the information that will be stored in the partition table.

# For those interested

Linux is a legend when it comes to disk. There is a ton of cool stuff to look for. Namely:

- `badblock` (be careful, it can be dangerous)
- ...
